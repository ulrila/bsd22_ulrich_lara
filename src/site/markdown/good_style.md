# Good style

## How to write good git commit messages:
- Line between summary/heading and main text
- Short summary/heading less than 50 characters
- Short summary/heading start with capital letter
- No . at the end 
- Use imperative mood in summary
- Main text should line break after 72 characters
- In main text describe what and why and not how

## How to write good source code comments
- Be Clear and Concise: Write comments that are easy to understand and get straight to the point. Avoid unnecessary or overly complex explanations.
- Explain Intent: Focus on explaining the why behind the code rather than restating what the code does. Clarify the purpose, rationale, and any important considerations.
- Use Proper Grammar and Formatting: Ensure your comments are grammatically correct and follow a consistent formatting style. Use proper punctuation and indentation.
- Avoid Redundancy: Avoid commenting on self-explanatory code. Instead, focus on providing insights into any complex logic, algorithms, or edge cases.
- Update Comments with Code Changes: Keep comments in sync with the code. When you modify code functionality, remember to update corresponding comments.
